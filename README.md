# Variational Encoder-Decoder Classifier combined with Variational Inference (VI)

### The objective of this project is to infer to a graph's latent space using Variational Inference, and specifically the Pyro library, in order to successfully represent an undirected graph into a latent space and predict the class of each node. The Cora dataset which consists of 2708 scientific publications classified into one of the seven subjects.
